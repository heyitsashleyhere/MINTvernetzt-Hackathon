# Mint-Vernetzt Project - Map and Match

## Hackathon group #3

### - Goal: Map users interest/needs and match people together based on similar criterias.

- Team members: Ashley, Maykal, Oliveira
- Idea: Display match results directly, in a dashbord, once logged in.
- General Info:
  - The time-frame for this project will only allow our focus in one main aspect
    - Algorithm functionality ( UX ) - ofcourse, also a simple layout page.
    - Or the UI only and focus on visuals.

Considering we work on the Algorithm idea, here are some reference steps we could use:

1. **Define all criterias / properties**: define not the how (visual) nut which data we will request from users, to use in our database for the matching process.

2. **Define scoring for each criteria**: Give importance to each criteria, to weight more or less in the overall matching results.

3. **Enhance logical performance gradually**: A pre-selection logic, filtering, sorting results, etc.
