## Hackathon group #3

### Members: [Ashley](https://github.com/heyitsashleyhere), [Maykal](https://github.com/maykaltenev), [Oliveira](https://github.com/OliveiraDCI)

### Goal: 
- Map users interests/needs and match other members in their community together based on similar criteria. 
- Somehow inspire more girls in STEM education.

### Solution: 

- Idea: Display match results directly, in a dashboard, once logged in at their [community page](https://community.mint-vernetzt.de/explore)
- General Info:
  - The time frame for this project will only allow our focus in one main aspect
    - Algorithm functionality ( UX ) - of course, also a simple layout page.
    - Or the UI only and focus on visuals.

Considering we work on the Algorithm idea, here are some reference steps we could use:

1. **Define all criterias / properties**: define not the how (visual) nut which data we will request from users, to use in our database for the matching process.

2. **Define scoring for each criteria**: Give importance to each criteria, to weight more or less in the overall matching results.

3. **Enhance logical performance gradually**: A pre-selection logic, filtering, sorting results, etc.
