## Hackathon group #3

- Team members: [Ashley](https://github.com/heyitsashleyhere), [Maykal](https://github.com/maykaltenev), [Oliveira](https://github.com/OliveiraDCI)

- Goals:
  - Map users interests/needs with other members in the community based on similar criteria.
  - Somehow inspire more girls to be interested in STEM education

- Approach:
  - Minimal change, avoid re-branding and graphic design 
  - Focus on features that can be added and scaled in the next 5 years

- Solution:

  - Display matched results directly on a dashboard, once logged in.
    - The whole prototype should be inserted and replace filters in the current [community page](https://community.mint-vernetzt.de/explore).
    - Cards can be flipped to create more 'human' interaction

  - Create an algorithm to match by percentage
    - User's can directly edit their fields without going to their profile edit page

  - News board to increase `girl in STEM` awareness 
    - possible to apply other topics of interests depending on seasons/holidays/events, ie Pride Month, Black History Month)
