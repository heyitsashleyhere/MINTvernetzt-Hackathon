## Hackathon group #3

- Team members: [Ashley](https://github.com/heyitsashleyhere), [Maykal](https://github.com/maykaltenev), [Oliveira](https://github.com/OliveiraDCI)
- Goals:
  - Map users interests/needs with other members in the community based on similar criteria.
  - Somehow inspire more girls to be interested in STEM education
- Solution: 
  - Display matched results directly on a dashboard, once logged in.
    - Cards can be flipped to create more 'human' interaction
  - Create an algorithm to match by percentage
    - User's can directly edit their fields without going to their profile edit page
  - News board to increase `girl in STEM` awareness 
    - possible to apply other topics of interests depending on seasons/holidays/events, ie Pride Month, Black History Month)
